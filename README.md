# Crypt AI

**Crypt AI** is an ephemeral, privacy-first AI chatbot built with **Next.js + Tailwind** on the frontend and **FastAPI** on the backend.  
It leverages Groq’s **LLaMA 3** model through a backend proxy to ensure **no chat history, no tracking, no logging, and no user accounts** — delivering a truly stateless and anonymous AI experience.
